Charles Stankievech, went to the North pole with the Canadian military for his latest film project. The Canadian forces have a military base, Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert, Signals Intelligence Station, which is 450 miles south of the North Pole. The base was built in the 50's as a joint project of the US and Canada and used to eavesdrop on Russia during the Cold War.

Stankievech created a series of beautiful and surreal black and white timelapse films during his stay in the subzero stillness.

“It is the place where the celestial meets the terrestrial,” says Stankievech of the landscape far north of the Arctic circle. “It’s as if the air has been sucked out of the Earth and outer space comes right down and touches you.”

Amazing imagery, I only wish the movie went for longer! Oh and he produced the music too, quite dark and industrial... perfect for the visuals.
