I have always been a fan of JD Twitch AKA Optimo, having been blown away when I first heard his Industrial sets on Beats In Space Radio and I loved his awesome Fabric Live mix. Optimo's live mixes from Panorama Bar/Berghain are always fantastic!

This mix again blew me away with the selection of music, elements of the night, Sci-Fi and Industrial darkness, haunting spoken word and tracks with a dreamlike atmosphere, both comforting and disturbing at the same time but utterly enchanting!

I listened to it on repeat for days while studying, perfect!
