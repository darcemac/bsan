There is something about man made objects that have been abandoned, decaying into history that I find fascinating, like relics from lost civilisations.

These are images from an underground submarine base in Balaklava, a town in the Crimea, Ukraine. This base was classified and fully operational until 1993. The base was built to withstand the direct impact of a nuclear weapon with a 56 meter thick layer of concrete. Nuclear submarines were able to enter and leave the base entirely underwater without being seen. Pretty spooky!
