Really cool dark Synthpop track from the Human League, taken from the Album The Golden Hour of The Future. I always thought the Human League were pretty cheesy based on their track 'Dont You Want Me' but I then listened to the album 'The Golden Hour of The Future' and was blown away and this track '4JG' was one of the standouts in my opinion!
