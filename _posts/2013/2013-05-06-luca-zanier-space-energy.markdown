Following on from previous posts about surreal and Sci-Fi like imagery is the work by photographer Luca Zanier.

In this series, Luca photographed more than fifty nuclear power plants, coal-fired power stations, nuclear waster storage facilities and other energy related systems. Luca captures the beauty of the complex shapes and colours and abstracts the environments from their true purpose.

"Enormous spaces, endless walkways, wide sluices, cryptic signs; all combined with miles of cables and pipes. They form a technical universe that radiates a cool logic. A hidden world, known only to a few and yet which has a huge influence on our day to day lives, absolutely essential in fact." - Luca Zanier

I find his work in this series really fascinating, mainly due to the fact the images are so alien to everyday life, beautiful and spectacular and in some, a hidden menace.
