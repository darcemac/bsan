Melvin Oliphant AKA Traxx, a Chicago native who also records under the alaises of Saturn V, X2, Villan X, Mutant Beat Dance, The Poetic Painter M, Lost Frequencies, J/M Strap, The Green Goblin and The Dirty Criminals... amongst others! I'm more familiar with his work with Beau Wanzer as Mutant Beat Dance.

This is fantastic mix of Industrial themed, analog drum machines and synth, dark and heavy but wickedly good!
