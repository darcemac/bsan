This looks like something from a Sci-Fi novel, rendered all the more striking in black and white.<br>
This is an abandoned US anti-ballistic missile system, Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard complex in Nekoma, North Dakota, USA. The Safeguard Program was a United States Army anti-ballistic missile system developed in the late 1960s. Safeguard was designed to protect U.S. ICBM missile sites from counterforce attack, keeping the option of an unimpeded retaliatory strike.

I wonder what Aliens will think of this in few hundred thousand years if they come across it?
