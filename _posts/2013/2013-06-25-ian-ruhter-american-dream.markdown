This is a really sinteresting short film on an american photographer, Ian Ruhter.

Ian has built his own truck and is cruising
across america with a huge custom made camera/darkroom in the back. He uses an oldschool technique of collodiol silver wetplates to capture images and its quite amazing the beautiful imagery that is produced.
