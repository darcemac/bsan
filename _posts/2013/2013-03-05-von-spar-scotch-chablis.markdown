This lush and dreamy track taken from the album Foreigner by the German pop group Von Spar, combines elements of Cosmic Disco, Psychedelic Pop and of course 70's Krautrock. Complete with spaced out trippy synth, echoing drums and guitar licks seemingly out of Miami Vice. Scotch & Chablis is a cool track to bliss out to and perhaps daydream about Sci-Fi adventures in a galaxy far away, fantastic stuff! Cool video too...
