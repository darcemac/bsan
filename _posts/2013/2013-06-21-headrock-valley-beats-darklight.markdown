Classic storming Nu-School breaks from 2002, I love the sounds now and would've loved it back when I was playing breaks!
I dont really know much about the producers or the record label though after checking out Discogs, I read that they had four releases as Headrock Valley Beats and Darklight is my favourite by far.
Would love to get this on vinyl as its an awesome atmospheric track!

Check it out below...
