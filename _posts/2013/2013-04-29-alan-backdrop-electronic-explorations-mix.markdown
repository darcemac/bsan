This is a mix from the awesome website [Electonic Explorations](http://electronicexplorations.org/), by a Dj/Producer that I have never heard of but think this DJ mix is really good with some absolute quality deep techno tracks. It features classics from Paperclip People, Donato Dozzy, Mike Huckaby and some of my favourite producers Heiko Laux and Pacou. All mixed on vinyl too, which is a plus!
