Wish I was a 70's child, the surfing was fresh and radical and the music was amazing! This is a clip from a North Shore standout Larry Bertlemann who was known for his low, compact turns and explosive above the lip re-entries called "Larry-als," He has been credited by the Dogtown crew as the single most influential person on their skating.
