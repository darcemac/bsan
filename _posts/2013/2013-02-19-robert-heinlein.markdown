Robert Heinlein and his Hugo winning novel, 'Stanger in a Strange Land', was my first introduction to the wonderful world of Science Fiction and I've been forever hooked and continue to be fascinated by Sci-Fi concepts and futurism. I find the cover artwork as fun as the writing and I especially dig the artwork that came out during the 60's and 70's.
