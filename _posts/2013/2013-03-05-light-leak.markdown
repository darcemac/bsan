A while ago I purchased a Canon QL17 G-111. This is a fantastic little 1970's 35mm rangefinder camera with a super fast lens rated at 40/1.7. I tested it wih a few rolls of cheap Fuji colour film and when I processed one of the rolls I discovered that there was light damage or 'retro effect' to the film. I really like the result though and almost prefer them to the undamaged photos!
