Deep spacey electronica is something that Legowelt does with passion and excellance and this latest [Melbourne Deepcast](http://www.melbournedeepcast.net/) mix has it all!

Legowelt's Deepcast mix has a fantastic tracklist of classic Detroit Techno, Chi-town and vocal deep house goodness, and right in the middle, a beautiful dub techno track from Basic Channel â€“ Q.1.1 II.
